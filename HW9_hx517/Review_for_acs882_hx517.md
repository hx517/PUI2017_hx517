## Comments
##### CLARITY: 
- The analysis looked at NYPD accident data on bicycle accidents. The graph is divided into two parts, the graph above shows the relative frequency of injuries and deaths, and the second half shows the magnitude of the difference. With the text, the whole figure takes some time to read, but it's still clear to understand.
**Recommendation**
- it would be more clear to read with a legend on the figure below.

##### ESTHETIC: 
- Good choice of color tones, differentiated by different color.This avoids unnecessary confusions. The overall color is very beautiful.
**Recommendation**
- If it is necessory to pick out some aesthetic problems, the color of death I might be more inclined to use some more sorely colors, other than light green(green signifies growth and life I think).

##### HONESTY: 
- A comparison may generate some misunderstandings, which compares the ratio of the number of injuries per hour to the total number of injuries in the 24-hour period and the percentage of all 24-hour deaths per hour in the same coordinates.The visual impression of this picture is that the number of deaths and injuries almost equal - it gave me a huge shock at first glance.
**Recommendation**
- would it be better to change the title from "Deaths vs. Injuries" to, like " Injuries percentage per hour in one day"? After all, injuries and deaths have different base number, so this comparison is unfair to some extent.
