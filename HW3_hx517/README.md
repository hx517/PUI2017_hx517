I discussed assignment 1 with Zhiao Zhou, Cheng Ma, Hongkai He . I came up with that to fit a Gaussian Distribution to the distribution of ALL sample means, we should set expect parameters which from the parameters we set for each distribution for final Gaussian Distribution, rather than calculating parameters( mu, sigma) from the new sample means distribution. Because you can get a gaussian distribution from any dataset you want, but to fit a thing with itself does not make any difference.

Zhiao Zhou guided me something about distribution.

Assignment 1:  
Plot Chi-square distribution, Normal distribution, Poisson distribution, Binomial distribution, and Beta distribution.
Plot the distribution of means with different sample size of each distribution.
Fit a gaussian to the distribution of means.

Assignment 2:

I did a group work with Yixuan Tang. She got the dataset. I choosed an Idea what we want to figure out and decide the Null hypothesis and Alternative hypothesis. We coded together.

Decide null and alternative hypothesis and assign a significance level 0.05 .
Store the data in PUIDATA and read the data.
Plot the number of trips from post-90s and pre-90s.
Add the statistical errors in the figure.
Normalize the distribution of trips.

Assignment 3:

Decide null and alternative hypothesis and assign a significance level.
drag data from professor's repo and read the data.
Calculating the Z-statistic and compared it with the limit of that significance level.
Draw a conclusion based on the result.
