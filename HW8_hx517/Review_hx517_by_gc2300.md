##### I plot NYC income map by zipcode.

#
The review first assesses the clarity of the plot, then analyzes the esthetic and honesty, finally a overall opinion will be given. 
#
### Clarity:
The plot is a map visulazing the NYC adjusted gross income by zipcode in 2014. The map is not very clear. First, there is no legend or interactive visulization about the income and the name of each zipcode area. The income may be represented by the color of each zipcode area, however, how the color should be interpreted is not clear. It could be better if there is a legend showing the corresponding number of income to the color used for each zipcode area. Besides, there is no labels for x and y axes.
#
### Esthetic:
The color used to describe zipcode areas range from white to deep blue. It should be noted that the zipcode areas marked with white or light blue looks similar to the background, which makes it difficult to read the map. It could be better to change the background color or add boundaries to the zipcode areas. The graphical elements may represent the quantities properly, but it's not convincing due to the lack of legend. Mapping the income using color is efficient, but may bring difficulty to read the plot when adjacent areas have similar colors. 
#
### Honesty:
The sense of recognizing color varies from one to another, which brings bias to extracting information from this map.It could be better if the exact numbers of income are marked on the map. Counterintuitive facts from the map lead readers to doubting about the precision of the data used. For example, the map shows Central Park has residents. I think the projection method can be wrong.

This visulization is interesting, and could be improved.
