**CLARITY**: *****is the plot easy to read? is it clear or confusing, are the quantities being visualized ambiguous?*****

The map makes it easy to notice trends. However, the plots needs a colorbar legend. I could *****assume***** that the darker blues mean higher AGI, but without a legend, I cannot be certain. 

Without knowing the quantities or legend, little information can be derived from this plot. For instance, I can tell that the Bronx is different from Brooklyn, but cannot be certain in what way.

The plot has a title, but lacks an informative caption. 

**ESTHETIC**: *****beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether you think it is 
"beautiful", but you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to communicate. Are the colors 
chosen appropriately? Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized? 
Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or are they distracting you?*****

The colors seem to be fine for color-blindness and are not distracting. 

Mapping at the zip code levels provides an ability to discern trends, but is not overly granular. 


**HONESTY**: *****is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?*****

The plot doesn't seem to be deforming data. One interesting element is that Central Park is dark blue. As no one "lives" in Central Park, there cannot be an AGI value. 


**IMPROVEMENTS TO PLOT**
All the above feedback could be used to make improvements. I think the two most urgent improvements are: 

- Add a legend 
- Add a caption
